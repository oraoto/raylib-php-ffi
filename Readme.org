* [[https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/][raylib]] binding for PHP
** Requirement
- PHP 7.4
- FFI extension
- libraylib.so 2.4-dev
** FFI limitations
   Only some basic examples works due to current FFI limitations:
   - FFI return struct/union is not implemented
   - FFI return array is not implemented
   - Nested struct is not supported ([[./ffi-patches/0001-FFI-add-nested-struct-support.patch][patch]])
